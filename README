Package: project3.tgz

Known Problems:
   allocator.c:
      This implementation currently does not function like a big bag of pages, but
      instead allocates a new page for each malloc/calloc/realloc call. Also, at a 
      larger number of calls a segfault usually occurs. I believe this is caused 
      because I am running out of memory and I am not checking before I use memory
      if the mmap worked.
   
Design:
   allocator.c:
